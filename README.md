# Evidence Portfolio

> An application to bridge the gap between Municipal Services and their Communities.

## Getting started

**GitHub:** https://github.com/mattpieterse/IIEVC-SAMSConnect

Watch the [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/hLbq6MNjTWg) to see the application in action and learn how to use the issue reporting feature (5min). For markers discretion, an optional [technical demonstration](https://youtu.be/lBYYz2pvQjU) and walkthrough of the codebase is available (10min). This demonstration is very brief, but covers all core aspects of the system if needed.

### Compiling the source code

See the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more information.

If you do not have Git installed and set up on your local machine, you can download a ZIP archive of the repository under the <kbd><> Code</kbd> dropdown menu. To compile the source code, run Visual Studio 2022 (or later versions) and open the uncompressed folder, then compile the project from the IDE. To do so, click the green run icon at the top of the screen.

#### Clone using a Command Line Interface (CLI)

1. Create/open an empty folder on your local machine to store the project files.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory of the folder.
  - **Windows:** To do this in an efficient manner, enter the folder in the default file explorer and click on the address bar. Then, type <kbd>C</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> to directly initialise a Windows terminal at the directory of your folder. This works with PowerShell in the same way. Watch a short [video guide](https://youtu.be/N7IqS3PX3YA?t=80) here.
3.  Clone this repository using the following command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mattpieterse/IIEVC-SAMSConnect
```

### Creating your first report

- From the homescreen menu, select <kbd>Create an Issue Report</kbd>.
- Fill in all of the required fields marked by an asterisk (*), ensuring that all validation rules are satisfied.
- Attach any relevant files in the interactive builder.
- Submit your claim.
